<!--Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x.

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).
Examples

countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]-->

Array.from problem

countBy = (x, n) => Array.from({length: n},(_,index) => x + index * x)
<!-- 
  first index is 0  so 1 + 0*1 = 1
  2nd index   is 1  so 2 +  1*2 = 4

[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
 -->
